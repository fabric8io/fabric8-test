POC test for OSIO using Pact

The test is a (very) simple/modified version of the test defined here: https://github.com/RedHatInsights/pact-python-demo/

All steps for running tests locally are defined here^

To run the test against a real/remote server:

pact-verifier --provider-base-url=https://openshift.io/api --pact-url=./tests/userserviceclient-userservice.json
INFO: Reading pact at ./tests/userserviceclient-userservice.json

Verifying a pact between UserServiceClient and UserService
  Given status exists
    a request for status
      with GET /status
        returns a response which

Original README file from https://github.com/RedHatInsights/pact-python-demo/ follows:


pact-python demo
================

This simple client/server implementation demos how pact-python can be used for a contract test.

Further reading about pact is at https://docs.pact.io/ or https://docs.pact.io/blogs-videos-and-articles

It has 3 components:
* `pact_python_demo/user-app.py` -- a simple flask app that has a REST endpoint for `/users/<name>` which returns a JSON representation of a user
* `pact_python_demo/client.py` -- a simple client that gets a user from user-app.
* `tests/test_client.py` -- a set of test cases using pytest and pact-python to test a simple
contract between the client and server.
* `broker/` -- contains docker-compose files for a pact broker server

Set up your virtual environment with:

```
$ pip install pipenv
$ pipenv install
```

## Creating/validating pacts without the broker

Enter your venv shell with:
```
$ pipenv shell
```

Run the test with:
```
(venv) $ pytest
```

You'll see a pact file is generated by this consumer test at `tests/userserviceclient-userservice.json`

Then, fire up your server-side app and verify the provider works as expected:
```
(venv) $ python pact_python_demo/user-app.py
(venv) $ pact-verifier --provider-base-url=http://localhost:5001 \
            --pact-url=tests/userserviceclient-userservice.json \
            --provider-states-setup-url=http://localhost:5001/_pact/provider_states
```

## Creating/validating pacts and publishing results to the pact broker
Next, you can try incorporating the pact broker in this process:

Start the broker server:
```
$ cd broker
$ docker-compose up
```
It's accessible at http://127.0.0.1 with username 'pactbroker' and password 'pactbroker'


To run the test, this time pushing the generated pact into the broker with version '0.1' of UserServiceClient, use:
```
(venv) $ pytest --publish-pact 0.1
```

The `tests/conftest.py` adds this custom option, and `tests/test_client` has code in the `pact` fixture to upload to the broker if the command line option was passed.


Then, you can validate the provider (UserService) and push the result to the broker by running:
```
(venv) $ python pact_python_demo/user-app.py
(venv) ./verify_pact.sh 0.2
```

This runs the same `pact-verifier` command as above but has additional args for pulling the pact file from the broker (instead of getting the .json locally) and pushing the verification result to the broker.

Log in to the broker and take a look at the matrix. You will see that UserClientService version 0.1 has been verified against UserService version 0.2


How does this work?
===================

The purpose of `test_client.py` is to simply verify that **if the server sends me what I'm expecting, MY client code behaves properly**. It is essentially a unit test to exercise your client code using a mocked server. Except in this case, the mock server is now a "pact mock provider". In the test, you have configured the mock provider server to respond to your client with certain data. This is the mock data to represent how you'd expect the provider to behave **given the proper state exists on the provider.** Using that mock data, you verify your client-side code works.

Two tests were created to verify that my client behaves properly if: a) I get a 200OK response back w/ the json I'd expect to see, or b) I get a 404 back and I should be returning `None`

For example, `client` expects that if `UserA` exists and it sends a GET to `/users/UserA`, it will get back JSON about UserA that has a name, uuid, timestamp for when the user was created, and a boolean indicating if the users is an admin or not. If the server responds with a 404, user client should return `None`.

When your tests pass, a json **pact file** is generated. The `user-app` team can then take this pact file, and use it to verify that their service responds to requests in the way your client expects.

## Provider states

A key part of this is **provider states**:
* `client.py` expects a 200OK response with json about 'UserA' **given that userA exists on the provider**
* In order for pact to verify the provider, `user-app.py` has to implement ways of **setting up the needed state**. This is done via a `provider-setup-url` which may reside on the provider app itself, or it could reside somewhere else (for example, some other test service you have setup that lives outside your provider app to populate your backend DB)
* In this demo, the user app has provided another REST endpoint at `/_pact/provider_states` which the `pact-verifier` will send POST requests to. Depending on the state the pact-verifier asks for, the provider will need to set itself up (e.g. make DB changes, or do other things) to get itself into "the right state" before the verifier sends the "request under test" to it.

## Isn't my server gonna send back different stuff?
Yes. The real server may respond with a timestamp or uuid that does not necessarily look like the mock values you created in your tests. Therefore, the `Term` object is used to say that **the server could send me anything that looks like this regex and that would be good for me, but for the purpose of this test I am using \<this fake value\>**.

The generated pact file used to verify the provider will only say "you need to be sending me data that looks like this regex" for timestamp and id. But, my client is not going to let server return with `name=UserB` if it asked for `name=UserA`, so the pact file is essentially saying "given that User A exists, and I send you a GET for userA, `name` in the JSON should be UserA"
